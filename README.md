You need to set once:

1. Your osu username

2. Your api_key and OAUTH_KEY: you can see them  [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api).

Finally, you need to set up your current lobby id in TARGET_CHANNEL (so each time you want to use the script in a new lobby):
You can find the id here when joining the lobby:

## Usage/Examples

Once in the osu lobby, type "!game" or "!g" in the chat to get a new map and mods automatically selected. The win condition will be sent as a message to the lobby.


## Features
For now, the possible objectives are:
- To be the closest to a precise acc, score, misscount, max combo or end combo
- To be the one with the most 50s or 100s
- To play the map in converted osu!catch and get the lowest score (i.e. avoid fruits as much as possible).

And the possible mods are:
- EZ
- HD
- HR
- HDHR
- FL
- EZHD
- EZFL

All this is easily customisable in the 'Games' section of the code.

 - The idea for the concept came from [Zylice's video](https://youtu.be/BeDRyiKFuhc?si=7DZXhXegZtOpDxB2)
